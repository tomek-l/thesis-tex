Wildfires are a growing problem in the US and worldwide -- in the last decade we witnessed some of the costliest, the most destructive and the deadliest wildland fires on record.

The consistent growth in number of incidents, affected area, and suppression costs[2] suggests that the issue
might become even worse in the future.

Solutions include early fire detection and preventative scanning of the vast wildlands.

I propose a vision-based fire detection system that, when deployed on an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV, drone) could detect wildfires early,
while they are still manageable. \cite{anastasiu-dsaa2016} #TODO: remove dummy citation
